## Overview

LocalePlus is a Flutter package that allows developers to easily retrieve data from the native device locale settings. With LocalePlus, developers can access information such as the device's language, country code, and time zone, as well as the device's number formatting preferences such as grouping and decimal separator. This makes it easy to build internationalized apps that provide a personalized experience for each user. Whether you're building a financial app that needs to display numbers in the user's local format or a social media app that needs to display timestamps in the user's time zone, LocalePlus has you covered. With a simple and intuitive API, LocalePlus is the perfect tool for any Flutter developer looking to add localization to their app.

## Requirements

## Installation

with Flutter:

```bash
flutter pub add locale_plus
```

```

## Usage
