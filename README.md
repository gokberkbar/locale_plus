# Overview

LocalePlus is a Flutter package that allows developers to easily retrieve data from the native device locale settings. With LocalePlus, developers can access information such as the device's language, country code, and time zone, as well as the device's number formatting preferences such as grouping and decimal separator. This makes it easy to build internationalized apps that provide a personalized experience for each user. Whether you're building a financial app that needs to display numbers in the user's local format or a social media app that needs to display timestamps in the user's time zone, LocalePlus has you covered. With a simple and intuitive API, LocalePlus is the perfect tool for any Flutter developer looking to add localization to their app.

# Requirements

- Dart sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"
- Flutter: ">=3.10.0"
- Android: minSdkVersion 16
- iOS 9.0+

# Installation

with Flutter:

```
$ flutter pub add locale_plus
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit `flutter pub get`):

```
dependencies:
  locale_plus: ^1.7.0
```

# Usage

## Patch the locales with the users' group and decimal seperators

This function patches all locales in flutter, so that you can use the decimal seperator and group seperator from `numberFormatSymbols` after the patch is complete.
The patchNumberSeperators function patches the locales on android and ios.
The `shouldPatchForSamsungKeyboard` can be enabled, to patch for Samsung keyboards on android phones (they only allow for a `.` as input).
It is safe to call on MacOS, Windows, Linux and web, but it does not patch the locales.

```Dart
import 'package:locale_plus/locale_plus.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await PatchAllLocales.patchNumberSeperators(
    shouldPatchForSamsungKeyboard: true,
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

final decimalSeparator = await LocalePlus().isUsingSamsungKeyboard();
